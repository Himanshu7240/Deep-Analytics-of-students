- **500 Internal Server Error** - When data loading or processing fails
- **Validation Errors** - When request parameters are invalid

## üîí Security Considerations

- The behavioral concerns endpoint returns confidential information
- Consider implementing authentication for production use
- Data should be properly secured in production environments

## üß™ Testing

2. **curl commands** as shown in the examples above
3. **Any HTTP client** like Postman or Insomnia

## üìà Performance

- The API is optimized for quick responses
- Data is loaded once per request for simplicity
- For production use, consider implementing caching
- Batch endpoints are available for processing multiple students efficiently

## ü§ù Contributing

To extend the API:

1. Add new endpoints to the appropriate router files
2. Update the Pydantic models for request/response validation
3. Add proper error handling
4. Update this README with new endpoint documentation

## üìù License

This project is for educational and demonstration purposes.

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that all data files are present in the `data/` directory
2. Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Check the console output for error messages
