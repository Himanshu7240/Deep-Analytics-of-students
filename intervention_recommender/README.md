# Intervention Recommender: Evidence-Based Support System

## Overview
The Intervention Recommender module is an **intelligent recommendation engine** that analyzes historical intervention data to provide evidence-based recommendations for student support strategies. Using machine learning principles and historical success analysis, it helps educators and counselors choose the most effective interventions based on proven outcomes.

## üéØ **What It Does**

### **Core Functionality:**
- **üîç Historical Analysis**: Analyzes past intervention outcomes and success rates
- **üìä Success Rate Calculation**: Determines effectiveness of different intervention types
- **üéØ Smart Recommendations**: Suggests best interventions based on problem type
- **üìà Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Uses data to guide intervention choices

### **Key Features:**
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Recommendations based on actual historical outcomes
- **Success Rate Analysis**: Quantitative measures of intervention effectiveness
- **Problem-Specific Matching**: Tailored recommendations for different student issues
- **Sample Size Validation**: Considers data reliability in recommendations

## ü§ñ **Recommendation Engine Approach**

### **Success Definition:**
The system defines intervention success as **academic improvement** in the term following the intervention:

```python
# Success metric: did the average score go up?
if next_term_scores['final_score'].mean() > current_term_scores['final_score'].mean():
    success_flags.append(1)  # Success
else:
    success_flags.append(0)  # Not a success
```

### **Recommendation Logic:**
1. **Problem Identification**: Matches student issues with historical problem categories
2. **Intervention Search**: Finds all historical interventions for similar problems
3. **Success Rate Calculation**: Computes effectiveness percentages for each intervention type
4. **Best Match Selection**: Recommends intervention with highest historical success rate
5. **Confidence Assessment**: Provides sample size and success rate for validation

### **Data Processing Flow:**
- **Term Mapping**: Links intervention dates to academic terms
- **Score Comparison**: Compares pre and post-intervention performance
- **Success Flagging**: Binary classification of intervention outcomes
- **Rate Aggregation**: Calculates success rates by problem and intervention type

## üìä **Sample Results & Analysis**

### **Current Recommendations (Based on Historical Data):**
```
Problem Type                    Recommended Intervention    Success Rate    Sample Size
Falling grades                 Academic Tutoring          100%            1 case
Low attendance                 Behavioral Counseling      0%              1 case
ADHD management                Standard counselor review  No data        -
Multiple disciplinary incidents Standard counselor review  No data        -
```

### **Key Insights:**
- **Academic Tutoring**: Shows 100% success rate for falling grades
- **Behavioral Counseling**: Limited success for attendance issues
- **Data Gaps**: Some problem types lack sufficient historical data

## üöÄ **Usage**

### **Run the Complete Analysis:**
```bash
# From repository root
python "intervention_recommender\recommend_intervention.py"

# From inside the module directory
python recommend_intervention.py
```

### **Custom Analysis:**
```python
from intervention_recommender.recommend_intervention import find_data_directory, recommend_intervention

# Use the path detection function in other scripts
data_path = find_data_directory()

# Get recommendations for specific problems
intervention, success_rate, sample_size = recommend_intervention("Falling grades")
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

### **Path Detection:**
Automatically detects data directory from multiple locations:
- `data/` (if running from root)
- `../data/` (if running from intervention_recommender subdirectory)
- `./data/` (if data is in current directory)

### **Recommendation Parameters:**
- **Success Threshold**: Academic improvement in subsequent term
