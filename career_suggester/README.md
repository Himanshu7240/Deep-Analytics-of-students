# Career Suggester: Intelligent Career & Stream Recommendation System

## Overview
The Career Suggester module is an **expert system** that analyzes student academic performance, extracurricular activities, and stated interests to provide intelligent career and educational stream recommendations. Using weighted scoring algorithms and career cluster matching, it helps students and educators make informed decisions about future educational and career pathways.

## üéØ **What It Does**

### **Core Functionality:**
- **üîç Student Profiling**: Creates comprehensive profiles from academic and engagement data
- **üìä Career Matching**: Scores student profiles against predefined career clusters
- **üéØ Stream Recommendations**: Suggests optimal educational streams and career paths
- **üìà Evidence-Based Guidance**: Uses data-driven insights for career planning

### **Key Features:**
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Considers academic strengths, activities, and interests
- **Weighted Scoring System**: Prioritizes different factors based on importance
- **Career Cluster Mapping**: Matches students to relevant career categories
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored suggestions for individual student profiles

## ü§ñ **Expert System Approach**

### **Career Cluster Knowledge Base:**
The system defines four main career clusters with specific attributes:

```python
CAREER_CLUSTERS = {
    'Engineering & Technology': {
        'strong_subjects': ['Math', 'Science'],
        'relevant_activities': ['Coding Club', 'Robotics', 'Science Olympiad', 'Physics'],
        'stated_interests': ['STEM', 'Technology', 'Engineer', 'IT', 'Software'],
        'weight': {'subject': 3, 'activity': 2, 'interest': 5}
    },
    'Medicine & Healthcare': {
        'strong_subjects': ['Science'],
        'relevant_activities': ['Volunteering', 'Science Club', 'Biology'],
        'stated_interests': ['Healthcare', 'Doctor', 'Nurse', 'Medical', 'Pharmacist'],
        'weight': {'subject': 4, 'activity': 3, 'interest': 5}
    },
    # ... additional clusters
}
```

### **Scoring Algorithm:**
- **Subject Strength**: Scores ‚â•80 in relevant subjects (weight: 3-4)
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Participation in relevant clubs/activities (weight: 2-3)
- **Stated Interests**: Career interest survey responses (weight: 5 - highest priority)

### **Recommendation Logic:**
1. **Profile Analysis**: Extract student strengths, activities, and interests
2. **Cluster Scoring**: Calculate match scores for each career cluster
3. **Ranking**: Sort recommendations by total match score
4. **Explanation**: Provide reasoning for each recommendation

## üìä **Sample Results & Analysis**

### **Current Recommendations (Based on Student Data):**
```
Student: Aarav Sharma (STU-001)
Academic Strengths: Math
Activities: Science Club, Science Club (Leader)
Interests: None provided

Top Recommendations:
1. Medicine & Healthcare (Match Score: 6)
   - Strong science focus and leadership in science activities
2. Engineering & Technology (Match Score: 3)
