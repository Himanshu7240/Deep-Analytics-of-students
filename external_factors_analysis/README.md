# External Factors Analysis: Impact on Student Performance

## Overview
The External Factors Analysis module examines how various **external factors** influence student academic performance. It analyzes the relationship between **parental education**, **parental occupation**, and **health factors** with student final scores to identify patterns and correlations that may impact educational outcomes.

## üéØ **What It Does**

### **Core Analysis Areas:**
- **üìö Parental Education Impact**: Analyzes how parents' highest education level correlates with student performance
- **üíº Parental Occupation Analysis**: Categorizes parental jobs and examines their relationship with academic outcomes
- **üè• Health Factors Assessment**: Investigates whether recorded health notes correlate with student performance

### **Key Insights:**
- **Educational Attainment Correlation**: Higher parental education generally correlates with better student performance
- **Occupational Category Patterns**: STEM/Academic backgrounds show strongest positive correlation
- **Health Factor Considerations**: Students with health notes show varied performance patterns
